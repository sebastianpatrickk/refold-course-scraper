  Course overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  Here at Refold, we're not here to teach you a language. Our goal is to teach you how to learn
  <em>
   any
  </em>
  language on your own, wherever and whenever you want to, by combining media immersion, strategic study, and the best tools and techniques out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Here are some of the general topics that we will be covering in this course:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Refold philosophy and language acquisition
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The basics of how to read and listen to your language
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to learn vocabulary and grammar so well that it becomes instinctual
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>

 <p>
  There are a few pieces of tech that we're using for this course: Kajabi, the Resource Database and the Discord community.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Course Platform
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Kajabi is the name of the platform that you're on right now! It hosts all the lovely content that you'll be using over the next 30 days. The video covers the most important aspects to keep in mind, but the most important thing is that you mark each lesson as "complete" (under the video) in order to unlock future content. Be sure to bookmark the front page of the course so that you can always get back easily! Or, if you ever forget,
  <a href="https://academy.refold.la/products/teach-yourself-a-language-course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   https://academy.refold.la/products/teach-yourself-a-language-course
  </a>
  will bring you there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Resource Database
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://refold.link/z3JJLXE6R36tY9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   This Google spreadsheet
  </a>
  will be your (second) best friend over the next month. In it, you can find materials relevant to each day of the course so that you never need to go searching for content on your own. If a tutorial or material is mentioned during the course, you can find it in the database, likely under the "Day number" of that lecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not all languages are supported. Clayton is amazing and knows about a lot of languages, but it's literally impossible to support every language. If your language isn't in the resource database, we are happy to give suggestions and make the search easier, but you will be mostly on your own for finding content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Find the database here:

    https://refold.link/z3JJLXE6R36tY9
   </a>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh, and bookmark the database so that you don't need to constantly refer back to this lesson!
 </p>

  The final piece of tech that you need is Discord! We use Discord to host a wonderful community exclusively for you all taking the course. Even if you're already in another Refold Discord server (or don't often use Discord), we highly recommend you
  <a href="https://discord.gg/AbaEsXDgJR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   join
  </a>
  . It's how you can ask questions to the Refold coaches and interact with the other course participants. Click this link to make an account and join:

  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout the course, you'll see links to daily discussions and "Ask questions," which will only work if you're logged into Discord. If you use it right, it can be one of the best resources now and into the future!
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you've checked out all the tech, move on to the next video!

   <strong>
    The Course Cheat Sheet
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   We've organized the entire course into a single spreadsheet, broken down by day and by concept into a single, easy to reference spreadsheet. We also include instructions for the homework on each day so that you can always check what to do in just a few moments.

  How to succeed in this course
 </h1>
 <p>
  This is a long course. 30 total days. We made it that length because we think it's vitally important to learn every single day and develop good habits around your learning. Plus, there's a lot to cover!
 </p>
 <p>
  The completion rate of online courses, across the whole internet, is very low. Anywhere from 5-15%. We want to make sure as many of you as possible achieve your dreams of fluency, which is why this lesson is all about "Creating your learning sanctuary."
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing is better at stopping you from learning than distractions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Distractions can hinder the learning process and make it difficult to concentrate. It is essential to have a safe learning environment free from distractions to enhance productivity and maximize learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Common distractions in the learning environment:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Noise, social media, TV, phone calls, etc.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    All of these distractions mess with your attention span and make it hard to focus. Trying to learn new things without being focused usually results in bad results.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Practical tips for creating a safe learning environment:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Set up a designated study area in your house that is a
    <em>
     different
    </em>
    place from your usual relaxation area.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Turn off the phone or keep it on silent
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Avoid social media
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Let other people you're living with know that you will be busy and not to disturb you
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Creating a safe learning environment free from distractions is crucial for effective learning. By following the practical tips discussed in this lesson, you can create a safe learning environment that will help you achieve your academic and personal goals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other critical decision that will help you complete the course is to set a time. Being specific with your time makes it much, much easier to learn every day. Choosing a consistent time to engage with the lessons of a course is important for establishing a routine, maximizing focus and attention, and enhancing retention of the material.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider your schedule and preferences, and then choose a time. It doesn't
  <em>
   have
  </em>
  to be the same each day (weekends might be different, for example), but there should be purpose behind your decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, you need to be consistent, and prioritize learning. Having a set time for learning each day can help you build habits and stick with them over time, train your brain to be primed for learning, and solidify the material in your memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each lesson will take around 20 minutes to complete. But, you'll also need to spend time with your language each day, so block off another 30–45 minutes each day for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you've chosen your times, put them into your calendar and set a reminder if you think you might need one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Answer all the questions below either with pen and paper or by copying to your personal notes. Please try to answer by saying “I will…”
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Where will you attend the lesson each day?
   <em>
    I will attend the lesson while sitting at…
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   Where will you do your homework each day?
  </li>
  <li>
   What will you tell the people you live with so you have privacy?
  </li>
  <li>
   What device will you use to watch the lessons?
  </li>
  <li>
   What device will you use to do your homework?
   <em>
    (A computer is highly recommended)
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   Will you take notes? If so, where and how in depth?
  </li>
  <li>
   Will you review past days during the course?
  </li>
  <li>
   When will you attend the lesson?
  </li>
  <li>
   When will you do your homework?
  </li>
  <li>
   How do your weekends look compared to the week? Do you need to make a different plan?
  </li>
  <li>
   Did you input this information into a calendar?
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  And finally, what are your personal goals for the last 30 days? What do you hope to achieve? Write some thoughts down in a file called "Teach Yourself A Language course goals” and we’ll review them later.

  Day 1: Phonetic Writing Systems
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to the first day of the course! We're thrilled to have you here! Today, our first lesson is all about phonetic writing systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a language learner, reading holds immense power—it is undoubtedly one of the
  <em>
   most effective
  </em>
  tools for acquiring and unlocking vocabulary in your chosen language. Before embarking on your reading journey, it's essential to understand how written words connect with the sounds they represent.
 </p>
 <p>
  In today's session, we will explore the diverse sounds found in various languages, the differences between phonetic and non-phonetic writing systems, and how to find and study the phonetic writing system for
  <em>
   your
  </em>
  language.

 <h1>
  Day 2: Refold Philosophy
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome back, everyone! Today we’re going over how and why our philosophy is different from conventional learning methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  In traditional methods, language learning often resembles solving math equations. They’re focused on memorization and drilling grammar rules so you can fill in the blanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The conventional approach will not make you fluent.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  At Refold, our focus lies in fostering a natural language instinct. Rather than fixating on rigid rules and equations, our goal is to show you how to immerse in the language and develop a deep understanding. Immersion is the best way to build an intuitive grasp of the language, paving the way for effortless speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are no shortcuts to fluency, but if you spend enough time in the language, you’ll not only develop an instinct for the language but learning it will be effortless — because you’ll be having fun.

  Day 3: Attention is Important
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to day 3! Yesterday we chatted about how the best way to build an instinct for your new language is to spend tons of time immersing in the language.
 </p>
 <p>
  But how are you supposed to pay attention and learn when you don’t even understand the language?
 </p>

  That’s what today’s lesson is all about! Today Ben will go over several strategies to help you pay attention to a language you can’t understand yet — and have fun doing it!

  Languages contain tens of thousands of words. However, some words are used a LOT more than others. By focusing on learning the most common words in a language first, you’ll be able to understand it comfortably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ben will walk you through how to efficiently learn the most frequent words, how many words you need to learn to understand your language, and how long it’ll take.

  Day 6: Tools for Priming
 </h1>
 <p>
  You’re almost done with your first week! Time sure does fly. Today’s lesson is all about tools you can utilize to make priming more effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reviewing vocabulary on a regular basis while immersing is one of the best ways to supercharge your ability to recognize and
  <em>
   truly
  </em>
  acquire vocab in your language. However, it’s easy to go overboard, so you’ll need to make sure you’re maintaining a good balance between priming with your tools and the amount of immersion you’re doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since our favorite priming tool is Anki, Ben will walk you through how to set it up in the most effective way possible and set yourself up for long-term success!

  Day 8: Hearing New Sounds
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to your second week of the Ultimate Immersion Course! Today’s lesson is all about the sounds that make up your language.
 </p>
 <p>
  No two languages share the exact same phonetic sounds. One of the biggest challenges learners face is the ability to hear and differentiate between sounds in a new language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since our brains are hardwired to ignore sounds that aren’t used in our own language, Ben will walk you through how to train your brain to hear the sounds of your target language.

  Day 9: Reading + Listening
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to day 9! Today’s lesson is about how to combine reading and listening.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we discussed in lesson 1, reading is one of the most powerful tools we have, as learners, to acquire vocabulary in our target language. When reading, you can see each individual word, how they're connected to other words, and look up anything you don’t know.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when the sounds of your new language are still hard to hear, you can’t connect the sounds of the language to the words you’re reading on the page.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why we recommend starting out by reading
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  listening at the same time. We call this ‘dual channel reading.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Ben will walk you through different ways to leverage this technique in your language-learning routine.

 </p>
 <p>
  Character systems, unlike alphabets, depict ideas, not sounds. Characters pose a unique challenge because you can’t sound out new words when you encounter them.
 </p>
 <p>
  These languages have tens of thousands of characters, but don’t worry! You won’t need to learn them all to become proficient in the language and learning them isn't as hard when you combine study with immersion!

  Day 13: Ambiguity
 </h1>
 <p>
  Day 13 is dedicated to dealing with ambiguity (or in other words, not understanding what the heck is going on).
 </p>
 <p>
  Adults have a hard time with ambiguity. We’re so used to understanding our native languages so completely that
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  understanding things in your target language can feel really jarring — or even make you feel stupid.
 </p>
 <p>
  You're NOT stupid. Not understanding is normal. It's something most language learners need to overcome, and we have good news. There are many strategies you can use to mitigate the discomfort of ambiguity. Ben will show you how to apply them to your own study routine.

  Day 15: What is Acquisition?
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to the first day of week 3! Today we'll learn about
  <em>
   acquisition,
  </em>
  understand what it means, and why we should acquire languages instead of learn them.
 </p>
 <p>
  In earlier lessons, we discussed the idea of developing an instinct for a language. To develop a natural instinct, you need to acquire a language instead of learn it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning a language implies memorization, but memorization is fragile. Have you ever crammed for a test and then forgot everything you learned within a week? The same principle applies here. When you acquire a language, you can’t remember ever
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  knowing it. It’s so ingrained in your memory it feels like it’s been there forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Listen in as Ben goes into even further detail, explains the benefits of acquisition over memorization, and helps you understand what this means for your own personal language journey.

  Day 16: From Zero to Fluency
 </h1>
 <p>
  Hey there, language learners! Today, we're diving into the process of achieving fluency.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here at Refold, we recommend a three-stage approach in the following order: reading, listening, and then output.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the reading phase, your objective is to expand your vocabulary and grammar knowledge. The listening phase focuses on training your ability to effortlessly follow native conversations at their natural pace without conscious effort. Finally, the output phase is where you'll put your understanding into practice and develop fluency in speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this session, Ben will walk you through the specific goals of each phase and shed light on the challenges and requirements for progressing to the next stage.

  Day 17: Consistency
 </h1>
 <p>
  Hey there, language learners! Today's lesson is one of our all-time favorites. So get ready as we delve into the exciting world of habits and consistency.
 </p>
 <p>
  You might believe that motivation is the key to success, but the truth is, motivation comes and goes—it's unreliable and beyond our control. Instead, the best way to guarantee your language-learning success is by developing solid habits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, there's a catch when it comes to forming solid, long-lasting habits. Most people try to take on too much at once and end up burning out. But fear not! Ben is here to guide you through the secret of building effective habits and more!

  Day 18: Interactive Immersion
 </h1>
 <p>
  Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of interactive immersion?
 </p>
 <p>
  When you're trying to develop a new skill, it's crucial to step out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself to expand your abilities. But that's just the beginning. To truly solidify those skills, we have something special for you: "interactive immersion."
 </p>
 <p>
  Interactive immersion is one of the most effective ways to enhance your language abilities. With this approach, you'll utilize various tools and techniques to delve even deeper into your immersive experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this lesson, Ben will walk you through how and when to apply different techniques to maximize the benefits of interactive immersion.

  Day 19: Intensive Reading
 </h1>
 <p>
  Yesterday, we had a great chat about interactive immersion, and today we're ready to put that knowledge into action with intensive reading!
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to intensive reading, there are a few key things to remember. First and foremost, a meta layer will be your best friend. Creating an easily accessible way to look up words while reading is crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's a strategy to approaching word lookups, as striking the right balance between ambiguity and using your resources is essential. In this lesson, Ben will guide you through maintaining that delicate equilibrium, ensuring you make the most out of your intensive reading.

 <p>
  Welcome to today's lesson on the 3 Pillars of Language Learning: Preparation, Interactive Immersion, and Freeflow!
 </p>
 <p>
  Preparation involves learning about the language, priming yourself for effective acquisition. Interactive Immersion expands your understanding through interactive experiences and the use of tools. Freeflow sharpens your instincts, transforming
  <span>
   conscious knowledge
  </span>
  into subconscious abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make maximum progress, it's crucial to balance all three pillars. Luckily, Ben is here to help you figure out the perfect blend in today's lesson.

  Day 22: Freeflow
 </h1>
 <p>
  In today's lesson, we'll explore the power of
  <em>
   freeflow immersion
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Freeflow immersion allows you to relax and enjoy the content while staying attentive. It not only enhances self-sufficiency by relying on your subconscious understanding, but also prepares you for real-world situations where you won't have your language tools readily available.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, one of the great advantages of freeflow immersion is that it provides up to five times more exposure to the language. However, if you're not engaged with what you're immersing with, you won't gain anything from it. That's why it's essential to choose content that aligns with your interests and skill level.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this lesson, Ben will help you discover the best content and strategies to maximize your freeflow immersion experience.

  Day 23: Increase Comprehension
 </h1>
 <p>
  Welcome to today's lesson! Today we’re talking about different ways to increase comprehension!
 </p>
 <p>
  Comprehension is the key to language learning success. Ideally, everything we immerse with in our target language would be both compelling and easily understandable. However, that's not always going to be the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  The good news is that there are ways to take charge of your comprehension. By using the right tools, strategies, and content, you can make content that’s normally beyond your level more accessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this lesson, Ben will walk you through everything you need to know to make your content more comprehensible.

  Day 24: Grammar
 </h1>
 <p>
  Are you ready to learn about grammar?
 </p>
 <p>
  In our course, you may have noticed that we haven't extensively delved into grammar. That’s intentional. When most people think of grammar, they imagine learning it the traditional way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Traditionally, grammar is taught via rote memorization, like math.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’re here to change that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than focusing solely on memorizing grammar rules for the purpose of speaking, our approach emphasizes learning
  <em>
   about
  </em>
  grammar to enhance comprehension.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this lesson, Ben will guide you through determining the optimal time to start learning grammar and show you how to study it effectively.

  Day 25: Expectations
 </h1>
 <p>
  Get ready because today’s lesson is all about setting realistic expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spoiler alert: achieving true fluency doesn't happen overnight or in 30, 60, or even 90 days!
 </p>
 <p>
  The truth is language learning takes a
  <em>
   long
  </em>
  time. How long? Well, the answer depends on your goals, what language you're learning, and the type of fluency you're aiming for.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this lesson, Ben will dive into different types of fluency and provide realistic timeframes to reach each goal. He’ll also give you examples of daily study routines to give you inspiration and show you what it takes
  <em>
   each day
  </em>
  to reach your language goals.

  Day 26: Time Tracking
 </h1>
 <p>
  Today we’re talking all about time tracking!
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Language learning takes time.
  </span>
  To stay motivated, it's important to shift our goals from focusing solely on results to setting daily behavior-based goals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time tracking is the key. By keeping track of the time you dedicate to the language, you can ensure you stay on track and have proof of your progress toward fluency.

  In this lesson, Ben will introduce you to time-tracking tools and techniques, and demonstrate how to track your progress effectively.

  Reflecting on the Course
 </h1>
 <p>
  Hi! This lesson is very quick.
 </p>
 <p>
  All you need to do is open the file you made back on Day 1. It should be titled "Ultimate Immersion Course Goals." And read the goals you wrote down for yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did you achieve those goals during the course?
 </p>
 <p>
  What
  <em>
   did
  </em>
  you accomplish? Is there anything that's holding you back?
 </p>
 <p>
  And remember, you can go back through the course as many times as you'd like, continuing to do the homework assignments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Great work!
 </p>

 <h1>
  You're a graduate now! What's next?
 </h1>
 <h2>
  Congratulations, you're officially an Ultimate Immersion Course graduate!
 </h2>
 <p>
  With the skills you learned throughout the course, your language goals are more reachable than ever! We're honored you took the time to take our course, and we wanted to share a few more things with you before you go.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   1. Don't hesitate to review course videos as many times as you need to.
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Some of the concepts taught in our course will require you to immerse in the language for a certain amount of time before they click. However, some other concepts might require you to rewatch the lesson video a few more times for the content to fully sink in. That's totally normal. Don't shy away from revisiting content whenever you have a question!
 </p>
 <h3>
  <strong>
   2. Keep doing your weekly reflections!
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Remember, language learning takes time
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  consistency. To make sure you stay on track, it's important to continue evaluating the personal learning system you built on day 27 of the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your system will never be perfect; there will always be ways you can improve it. Don’t be afraid to mix it up and try new things. But always remember: consistency before intensity!
 </p>
 <h3>
  3. Take the graduate feedback survey.
 </h3>
 <p>
  Take the graduate feedback survey here:

   <span>
    https://refold.link/UCGradSurvey
   </span>
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Our goal is to help as many learners reach their language goals as possible. Your feedback will directly help us improve this course and create even more courses and programs for you and other learners.
 </p>
 <h3>
  4. Share the course with your friends!
 </h3>
 <p>
  Friends don't let friends learn languages alone. If you have a friend who's interested in learning a language, tell them about this course so they can be successful too and join you on your learning journey!
 </p>
 <h3>
  5.  Evaluate if 1-on-1 coaching is right for you.
 </h3>
 <p>
  If you feel like group courses aren't providing you enough support on your language journey, we also offer 1-on-1 coaching! If you choose to pursue coaching, you'll meet with our head coach, Ethan, to discuss any issues you're facing. Then, Ethan will give you concrete and actionable steps to get you on track to success.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you and Ethan decide that a longer-term 1-on-1 coaching program is right for you, Ethan will design your coaching program and assign you the perfect Refold coach for your needs.
 </p>

  <strong>
   6.  Stay connected in the course Discord community!
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We'd love to continue hearing from you, and so would your fellow learners! Did you know that learning along with a community increases your odds of success? Not only that, but it'll make the entire journey a LOT more fun!

 <h1>
  Take the Graduation Survey
 </h1>
 <p>
  The final thing to do to complete the course is to take the offboarding survey!
  <a href="https://refold.link/UCGradSurvey">
   https://refold.link/UCGradSurvey
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you've completed the survey, you will be added to the list of graduates and granted access to the graduate chat on the Discord server. We've made most of the survey optional and quick, so don't worry about it taking a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amazing work!
